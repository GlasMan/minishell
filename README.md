# minishell
As the name implies, this project is about creating a simple shell in C, taking bash as a reference.
Impementation of clasic bash written completely from scratch with [Ahmet Hakan Gunes](https://github.com/ahmethakangunes) as part of 42 Ciriculum.
+ This custom shell has most of the features from original bash like custom enironment, builtins, pipes, multiple redirections, logical operators and parenthesis, signal and error handling.
+ It works by geting input from user. Then dividing it into tokens. Then parsing it into varios data structures and executing.
